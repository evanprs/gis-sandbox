## bookmarklet

Potree doesn't come with a "go to location" pane by default. To add one, make a new bookmark with the code form bookmarklet.js as the URL, and simply click it when you've got a potree page open. 

The input box will accept either lat/long or EPSG:3857 as input coordinate reference systems. If no Z coordinate is given, it will use the current camera height
